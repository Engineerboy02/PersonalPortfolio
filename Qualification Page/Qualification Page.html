    <h1>JOHN LINDQUIST</h1>
    <h3>REALLY AWESOME HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>My name is John Lindquist, a High school student at Delta High School, and an Eagle Scout. I am applying for an internship position. Some of my qualifications include certification in Word, proficiency in SolidWorks and AutoCAD, and knowledge in CorelDRAW, MakerBot, and Arduino IDE.</p>
	<p>An internship in robotics would be a perfect fit for me because I am a hard-working student and have had leadership and computer program experience. My leadership experience in scouting includes being an assistant senior patrol leader, the senior patrol leader, and quartermaster and at school in group projects. Computer programs I have experience in are SolidWorks, AutoCAD, CorelDRAW, MakerBot, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Microsoft windows. Some of the projects I have been a part of a bridge building group. I made the design in SolidWorks and a friend built it then we weight tested it. Another project has been designing a house for Habitat for Humanity in a 2D drawing presenting it. Now we are turning the 2D drawings into 3D drawings and rendering them with textures in AutoCAD.</p> 
	<!-- <p>I feel like I am a good fit for an internship at your company based on my qualifications. I would love for you to give me a call about scheduling an interview. Thank you for considering me for an internship.</p> -->
